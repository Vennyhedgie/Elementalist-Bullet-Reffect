Then right click > Extract here (the necessary files will be added to the packs and icons subfolders).

Then, return to reffect ingame and refresh packs.

# Notes

This effect is made with Normal interface size. If you use a different one, you can resize all the elements at once by right-clicking on the pack and selecting resize. Alternatively, you can move the pack's position on screen if needed, though it should be aligned by default.

Unfortunately, due to attunement icons changing sizes depending on which one is active, these icons will never be perfectly aligned, though the variance is fairly minimal.
